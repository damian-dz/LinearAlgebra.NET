# NET.Algebra

This simple library should provide basic functionality for solving some of the common algebra problems. At the moment, it focuses mostly on matrices.

## Matrices
In order to create a new Matrix object, you can type:

```c#
var mat = new Matrix(3, 4);
```
This will create a matrix with 3 rows and 4 columns.
